# What is IaC?

IaC is managing and provisioning IT infrastructures using code and automation, without necessarily dealing directly with the physical structure of the devices. We configure all the necessary structures using only codes and software, which will create a consistent, reproducible and scalable structure.

Basically, with IaC it is possible to create scripts that will provision and allocate an entire IT structure so that we can run different types of applications, such as servers, databases, networks and other resources.

Infrastructure can be understood as the set of all physical and virtual resources necessary to support the development, testing, deployment and operation of software.

# What is Terraform?

Terraform is a platform that allows an IT infrastructure as code to be described in a script, which will create, change and manage the structure in an automated way. It allows infrastructures to be managed abstractly, that is, independent of the cloud provider.

Basically, it is an IaC script creation and provisioning platform.

# What is Docker?

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products that use operating system-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

Using Kernel sharing from the host machine and the virtualized machine, Docker and its containers are able to isolate only the necessary configurations of an OS and create lighter virtual systems, as they only consume the resources necessary for their operation.

### What is Docker Image?

A container image is a file executed in a Docker environment that has a series of packages containing all the libraries, dependencies and files necessary to run the container. It's basically the file for creating and configuring a Docker container.

# What is DevOps and how does it relate to IaC?

DevOps is an area of IT that seeks to approach relationships between Development and Operations of applications and systems closer together, seeking collaboration between them and continuous development, in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the software delivery process.

Strongly linked to IaC concepts, which allow the management and configuration of IT infrastructures in an automated and user-friendly way, using code instead of physical manipulations and in a shared, versioned, tested and easy-to-manage manner.

Basically, IaC is a fundamental practice for implementing DevOps, as it allows the implementation of structures in a simplified way that can be shared by different areas.
