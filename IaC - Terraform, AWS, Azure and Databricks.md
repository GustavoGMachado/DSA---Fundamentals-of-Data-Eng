# What is IaC?

IaC is managing and provisioning IT infrastructures using code and automation, without necessarily dealing directly with the physical structure of the devices. We configure all the necessary structures using only codes and software, which will create a consistent, reproducible and scalable structure.

Basically, with IaC it is possible to create scripts that will provision and allocate an entire IT structure so that we can run different types of applications, such as servers, databases, networks and other resources.

# What is Terraform?

Terraform is a platform that allows an IT infrastructure as code to be described in a script, which will create, change and manage the structure in an automated way. It allows infrastructures to be managed abstractly, that is, independent of the cloud provider.

Basically, it is an IaC script creation and provisioning platform.
